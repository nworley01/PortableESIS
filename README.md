# PortableESIS
Python scripts for ES and IS protocols for a portable system

This project is in its beginning stages. 

The original ES/IS programs are written in python 2.7 and need to be updated to python 3. 
I plan to make the user interface in PyQt5.
Ideally the user interface will stand alone, but have a selection menu for difference ES/IS protocol. Thus, adding a new protocol should be as easy as adding a new python file to a folder. 
The portable system will include a window laptop and a labjack U3-LV, though the program should be ideally be OS agnostic.
